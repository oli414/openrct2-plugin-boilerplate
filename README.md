# OpenRCT2 plugin boilerplate
This boilerplate project (starting point to create OpenRCT2 plugins with) allows you to create a multi-file ES6 OpenRCT2 plugin and have it transpiled to a single ES5 file (Which OpenRCT2 supports).

## Installation
- Clone or download the project and put it somewhere on your computer.
- Run `npm install` to install all the required packages (Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if npm is not recognized).
- In the package.json and `src/index.js`, replace `MYPLUGINNAME` with the name of your plugin, and replace `OPENRCT2PATH` with the path to your OpenRCT2 directory.

## Build
You can build your project using the following commands:
- `npm run build` Manually build the project
- `npm run watch build` Automatically build everytime a source file is updated
If the installation was done correctly the transpiled JS file can be found in both the `build` directory and in the `plugin` directory of OpenRCT2. 
With hotreloading enabled and the watch command being used you no longer have to restart the game, and move files around manually.

## Development
You can create your project in the `src` directory. The `index.js` file is the root of your project, from there feel free to [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) other modules (files).
